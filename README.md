## What is Zabastcom?
 Zabastcom is nonprofit project which aggregates news in the field of labor conflicts

## Domain entities of application:
### Conflict
 One of the main entities.
 Combines events into chains. Conflicts can branch by attaching to events of other conflicts.
 The database uses a nested set to bind to a specific parent event.
 API users cannot enter conflicting data (e.g. parent_event is not included in the list of parent conflict events)
 because they donâ€™t have the ability to change parent_id.
 A nested set is used for ease of querying.
